I would like to become a proficient programmer, I can do a bit of C++ and I know how useful it is but I'm much more excited about Rust at the moment. Much of this excitement is thanks to #No_Boilerplate on #YouTube . 
He sets out a great deal of the [[Metal-Learning]] in [this video](https://youtu.be/2hXNd6x9sZs?si=1LadQgzsU_xHV3jH) (with accompanying Obsidian doc [here](https://github.com/0atman/noboilerplate/blob/87f47025f6fe625a00034df62288daa00b490458/scripts/22-starting-rust.md#L54)). The pathway for learning rust he sets out is as follows
1. Read [[Ultralearning]]
2. Join the discord
3. Read [The Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) all the way through as fast as possible
4. Watch #No_Boilerplate  [Rust talks ]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifaLk5v3W90&list=PLZaoyhMXgBzoM9bfb5pyUOT3zjnaDdSEP&index=6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifaLk5v3W90&list=PLZaoyhMXgBzoM9bfb5pyUOT3zjnaDdSEP&index=6) 
5. Go through [The Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) properly doing all the exercises.
6. Follow [rust by example/](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
7. [[#Rustlings]] katas 
8. [[#Haskell]]

# [[The Rust Programming Language Book]]
[The Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) refers to a book called "The Rust Programming Language". There are several versions of the book;
## https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/
This is the the book in a fairly raw format, a clean series of HTML documents for each chapter.
## https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/
The brown university version has interactive quizzes for each chapter.
